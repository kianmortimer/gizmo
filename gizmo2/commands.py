    This function should only be accessed from bot.py and only once.
    All commands are slash commands, meaning they are accessible through
    Discord's new slash system only and not direct messages.

    Guild commands are guild specific:
    Explicitly specified through the argument "guild_ids=[]".
    This type of command updates immediately but cannot be used
    outside of the specified guilds. Guild commands should be used
    for testing as a result of updating immediately.

    Global commands are accessible in all guilds and direct messages:
    Implicitly specified through omitting the "guild_ids=[]" argument.
    This type of command can take up to an hour to update and therefore
    should not be used for testing purposes.
