    The purpose is to confirm a platform and id of the target.
    This can be achieved by first defining the search term for
    ballchasing.com using regex, and then running through a
    sequence of replay searches where the more specific search terms
    get applied first.

    Using regular expressions, the user input can be filtered
    into a tuple in the format (<platform>, <id>)

    The more specific search terms are more efficient and therefore
    we apply them before the more arbitrary terms.
    e.g. steam:76561198438198955 will have a lower complexity than
         any:joryx

    We search replays with the "deep=False" parameter in the
    ballchasing API because at this stage we don't care about receiving
    all the stats and instead are just scouting to find the replays.

     - Search by name (pro replays only)
       Only if platform matches or platform wasn't specified
     - Search by name (any replays)
       Only if platform was specified, and only accept matching platform
     - Check Steam URL ID (platform is unspecified)
